 comprehensive analysis of customer data using Power BI. The objective was to visualize and gain insights from the data, focusing on customer demographics and product categories.

ðŸ“ˆThe analysis includes the following key visualizations:

Customer Distribution by Age: illustrates the number of customers across different age groups, providing insights into the demographic distribution.

Customer Distribution by Time: This visualization shows the count of customers segmented by year, quarter, month, and day, helping identify trends over time.

Customer Distribution by Gender: displays the distribution of customers by gender, highlighting any significant differences.

Total Amount by Product Category: depicts the total revenue generated by each product category, allowing for easy comparison.

Quantity by Product Category: shows the total quantity of products sold in each category, helping to identify popular items.

The cards display key metrics:

Average Age: 41.39 Total Customers: 1000 Total Quantity Sold: 2514 Total Amount Sold: 465 000$ Total Transactions: 1000 Additionally, I implemented filters for product category, date, gender, quantity, and age, providing users with the ability to refine their analysis.

Findings:

The analysis of customer distribution by age reveals no specific relationship between age and the quantity of products sold. This indicates that purchasing behavior may not be strongly influenced by the customerâ€™s age. There are notable peaks in the quantity sold on May 20, 2023, and again in July, suggesting higher purchasing activity during these periods. The customer distribution by gender shows that 49% of customers are female, while 51% are male. In terms of total amount sold by product category, electronics is the top category, generating the highest revenue, followed by clothing, with beauty ranking last. Similarly, when looking at quantity sold by product category, electronics makes up 33.77%, clothing is slightly higher at 35.56%, and beauty is the smallest category at 3.67%. This project demonstrates the power of Power BI in analyzing customer data and deriving actionable insights. The visualizations created provide a clear understanding of customer behavior and preferences, which can help businesses make informed decisions.
